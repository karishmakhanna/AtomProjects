// Q: What is the most important shortcoming of the function youâ€™ve written when compared to a for loop in C++?
// A: This function is recursive, whereas in C++ it would be iterative. The most important
// shortcoming is that the loop element is CBN, which means that for complicated expressions,
// there would be many evaluations. The larger the loop is, the more the expression is evaluated.
